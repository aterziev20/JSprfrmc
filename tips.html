        <h1> 7 Ways to improve JavaScript Performance</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Reduce Activity in Loops
                <p class="tips">In programming, loops are frequently used. Each statement in a loop, including the
                    <i>for</i> statement, is executed for each iteration of the loop. Statements or assignments that can
                    be placed outside the loop will make the loop run faster.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Reduce DOM Access
                <p class="tips">Accessing the HTML DOM is very slow, compared to other JavaScript statements.
                    If you expect to access a DOM element several times, access it once, and use it as a local variable.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Reduce DOM Size
                <p class="tips">Keep the number of elements in the HTML DOM small. This will always improve page
                    loading, and speed up rendering, especially on smaller devices. Every attempt to search the DOM
                    (like <i>getElementsById</i>) will benefit from a smaller DOM.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Avoid Unnecessary Variables
                <p class="tips">Don't create more variables than necessary, only create variables that you will use and
                    save values to them.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Delay JavaScript Loading
                <p class="tips">Putting your scripts at the bottom of the page body lets the browser load the page
                    first. While a script is downloading, the browser will not start any other downloads. In addition
                    all parsing and rendering activity might be blocked. Another way to improve performance is to use
                    <i>defer</i> in the script tag. The <i>defer</i> attribute specifies that the script should be
                    executed after the page has finished parsing, but it only works for external scripts.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Avoid Using <i>with</i>
                <p class="tips">Using the <i>with</i> keyword has a negative performance impact. It also clutters up
                    JavaScriptscopes.The <i>with</i> keyword is not allowed in strict mode.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Delete unused lines of code
                <p class="tips">This one should be obvious, but make sure to read your code and delete any unused lines
                    of code.</p>
            </li>
